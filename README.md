Each file can contain smaller deps, but will have a big dep at the end combining them that follows the name of the file. For example. `apps.rb` will have a runnable dep calls `apps` which will in turn, run all the individual app deps`.

You can rerun the deps and fetch any updates to the repo with the `--update` flag like so: `babushka spencerldixon:deps --update`
