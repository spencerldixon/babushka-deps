Babushka set up script for my development environment.

Babushka will set up a blank macbook the way I like it; installing ruby, postgres, git, and configuring OSX behaviour and my favourite apps.

To install run:

```sh -c "`curl https://babushka.me/up`"```

Then:

```babushka spencerldixon:work```

or...

```babushka spencerldixon:play```

Which will install some personal applications too as well as everything work
